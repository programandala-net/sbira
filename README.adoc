== Description

ZX Beep is a QL SuperBASIC procedure that emulates the `beep` command
of ZX Spectrum's Sinclair BASIC.

ZX Beep was written for the
http://programandala.net/es.programa.ritimba.html[Ritimba] project.

ZX Beep has been tested with
http://www.wlenerz.com/SMSQmulator/[SMSQmulator].

== Files

- zx_beep.bas: The main source, written in
  http://programandala.net/es.programa.sbim.html[SBim] format.
- zx_beep_bas: Automatic conversion to SuperBASIC format.
- Makefile: the `make` file that converts from <zx_beep.bas> to
  <zx_beep_bas>.

== Usage example

----
merge zx_beep_bas
init_zx_beep
let zx_beep_tempo=2.1:rem Default. Adjust to your machine.
zx_beep seconds,pitch
----

Where "seconds" and "pitch" are the parameters
accepted by ZX Spectrum's 'beep' command (not their
whole ranges, though).
