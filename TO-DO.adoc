== 2017-09-18: zx_beep.bas

- Fix: the notes are shorter/faster than on the ZX Spectrum, unless
  `zx_bleep_tempo` is used, but the time conversion seems fine.
- Confirm: SBASIC's `beep 0,x`  does not play forever, contrary to
  what the manual reads, at least on SMSQmulator.
- Improve: Simplify the tempo configuration: The default calculation
  `zx_bleep_tempo*1000000/72`, being `zx_bleep_tempo` 2.1, could be
  replaced with a `zx_bleep_tempo`, provided its default value is
  29166.67. Less intuitive, though. Anyway, `1000000/72` should be
  replaced with its value.

- Add `#include` to support requirements. First, SBim must be improved
  to manage relative paths and check duplicated includings.

- Add `rem` rulers to modules, to apart them in the target
  <sbira_bas>.

== 2017-10-20

- Write function variants of the procedures that load images, to
  return the I/O result.
- Homogenize notation of parameters, eg. `ch%` vs `channel%` vs
  `chan%`; `txt$` vs `text$`...
