== ZX Beep

=== 2017-09-18

Fix: the notes are shorter/faster than on the ZX Spectrum, unless
`zx_bleep_tempo` is used, but the time conversion seems fine.

Confirm: SBASIC's `beep 0,x`  does not play forever, contrary to what
the manual reads, at least on SMSQmulator.

Improve: Simplify the tempo configuration: The default calculation
`zx_bleep_tempo*1000000/72`, being `zx_bleep_tempo` 2.1, could be
replaced with a `zx_bleep_tempo`, provided its default value is
29166.67. Less intuitive, though. Anyway, `1000000/72` should be
replaced with its value.
